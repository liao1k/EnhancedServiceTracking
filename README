CCF WebApp is the root of a web based application. Using the web 
scripting language php with HTML and JavaScript, connecting to a MySQL
database, WebApp can be used to create powerful data driven 
applications. The WebApp was started in the design of the Cardio 
Thoracic Surgery "Study Tracker" project and refined greatly in the 
"Patient Access" system. It was then distilled out of those systems 
into an application template system that is the "WebApp".

=======================================================================
Initial setup files. 
=======================================================================
application.php

application.php is the main config file. You will need to change the 
following variables.

$CFG->dbhost, $CFG->dbname and $CFG->wwwhost.

If you want to use Bugzilla to track application issues, you'll need to
setup your Bugzilla project and change the variables in the Bugzilla
parameters to connect to your server. 

The Application Parameters are for titles on the web pages, and to find
the style sheet to define the look and feel of the application.


WebApp.css

Before you can use this file, you'll need to rename it to match the
value of $CFG->appname.

========================================================================
Page Files
========================================================================

Once the app is setup, there are three main files you will need to work
on for each page you wish to display.
